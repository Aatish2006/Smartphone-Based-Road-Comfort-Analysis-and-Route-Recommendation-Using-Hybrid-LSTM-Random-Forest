# Smartphone-Based-Road-Comfort-Analysis-and-Route-Recommendation-Using-Hybrid-LSTM-Random-Forest
This project uses smartphone sensors to analyze road comfort and detect potholes using a hybrid LSTM–Random Forest model. Sensor data is processed using event‑triggered inference and aggregated across vehicles. Comfort‑aware routes are visualized on a map using color‑coded overlays.
